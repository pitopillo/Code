   <p>My name is Noel Alvarez but I go by Barney. I'm 36 years of age and I'm happily married with two incredible children. My daughter's name is Sarai Victoria and she is 4 years old and my son's name is Malakai Josiah and he's 9 months old. They keep me incredibly busy. I currently work at JP Morgan Chase as a Operations Business Analyst. My favorite things to do are to serve at my church, play video games, play basketball and spend time beating my wife and daughter at UNO's.</p>
